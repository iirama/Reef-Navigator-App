# Reef Navigator App

The “Reef’s Navigator” App introduces a mobile application designed to enhance maritime safety 
by providing sailors with a comprehensive map, facilitating the identification of safe routes and 
avoiding collisions with coral reefs in the Red Sea. Using the advantages of Flutter for cross- 
platform development and Mapbox for mapping technology, the application integrates AI-driven 
features to dynamically compute and recommend secure routes. The primary objectives include 
utilizing Allen Coral Atlas data to pinpoint reef locations, implementing Mapbox for interactive 
mapping, and incorporating AI algorithms for real-time route optimization. The project employs 
Flutter framework for the application’s front-end, Mapbox for mapping functionality, and integrates 
Firebase for user authentication and data storage. Geospatial data from the Allen Atlas Coral is 
retrieved to dynamically populate the map with reef locations. The application combines user
friendly navigation, offering sailor a reliable tool to navigate the Red Sea safely
